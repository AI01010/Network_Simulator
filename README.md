Developed a discrete-time host network simulator in Java to simulate host-to-host pinging and calculate round time trip. 
Based on a star-topology network were hosts can send and receive pings back and forth simultaneously.
Program takes input to boostrap the simuation, then fires off timers for each ping request in discrete time.
